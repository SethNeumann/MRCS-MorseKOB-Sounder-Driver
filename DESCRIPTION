The MorseKOB Sounder Driver is a simple circuit board to drive a real telegraph sounder from the popular freeware American (“Railroad”) Morse code practice utility: MorseKOB.

I developed this board from a sample circuit on the MorseKOB site at https://sites.google.com/site/morsekob/morsekob25/interface?authuser=0.
The MorseKOB Sounder Driver is a compact board, about 2” x 2” that provides a single place to make all your connections: RS232 Dongle, Power and a Sounder.
